Pygo
====
Not only the smallest of the Piranha family of fishes but also a derivative of
the [PACU](https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/pacu) framework that duplicates
two of the modules there without dragging the whole framework along.  As such
this is distributed under the same license, the short of which is it's for
private use only.

**NOTE:** While this is an extremely stealthy form of recon in AWS as far as the
target account goes, Amazon most certainly knows what you are doing as this is
far from normal API behavior (not to mention there are some limits you will hit).
Please don't use this little tool to get yourself clapped.

Usage
